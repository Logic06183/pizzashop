## System Design
For additional insights into the system design of this application, please refer to the document provided [here.](/docs/system-design.md)

## Running the Project Locally
1. **Run using Docker Compose**: Ensure you have Docker Compose installed on your system. Navigate to the project's root directory and run the following command to build and start the application and its services:

   ```
   docker compose up -d
   ```

2. **Access the Application**: After successfully launching the containers, you can access the application in your web browser at http://localhost:8000
3. **Demo Admin Access** : To access the admin panel, visit http://localhost:8000/admin and use the following credentials:

    - Username: `demo`
    - Password: `demo@123`

4. **Social Authentication**: The project includes built-in support for social authentication with Google, Facebook, and Github.

    - [Google OAuth](https://docs.allauth.org/en/latest/socialaccount/providers/google.html#app-registration): This feature is readily available and uses demo credentials configured within the app. If you wish to use your own credentials, modify the Google App entry at the following link: `http://localhost:8000/admin/socialaccount/socialapp/`.

    - [Facebook OAuth](https://docs.allauth.org/en/latest/socialaccount/providers/facebook.html): Out-of-the-box functionality is not provided for Facebook Authentication. However, you can refer to the [django-allauth docs](https://docs.allauth.org/en/latest/socialaccount/providers/facebook.html) and follow the steps to add a social app through the following link: `http://localhost:8000/admin/socialaccount/socialapp/add/`

    - [GitHub OAuth](https://docs.allauth.org/en/latest/socialaccount/providers/github.html): Similar to Facebook Authentication, GitHub Authentication requires configuration and does not work automatically. Follow the instructions in the [django-allauth docs](https://docs.allauth.org/en/latest/socialaccount/providers/github.html) to add an entry here: `http://localhost:8000/admin/socialaccount/socialapp/add/`.

5. **Google reCAPTCHA**: By default, the project uses Google's testing keys when in development mode.


## Deploying the Project:
To deploy the project to a production environment, utilize our Docker Compose setup as follows:

### Step 1: Clone the project on server
Begin by cloning the project repository onto your server using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/user-name/repo-name.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd pizzashop
```


### Step 2: Installing Docker and Docker Compose
For production deployment, it is presumed that you are operating on a Linux-based server. Refer to any of the Digital Ocean tutorials tailored to your Linux distribution for installing Docker. These tutorials can be found [here.](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial-collections/how-to-install-and-use-docker)

### Step 3: Configuring Environment Variables
Before running the project, configure the necessary environment variables for key dependencies. These include:

- `DEBUG`
- `SECRET_KEY`
- `DATABASE_URL`
- `ALLOWED_HOSTS`
- `RECAPTCHA_PUBLIC`
- `RECAPTCHA_PRIVATE`
- `STRIPE_KEY`
- `SENDGRID_API`

#### Step 3.1: Copy the .env.example File
Execute the following command to create a copy of the environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

#### Step 3.2: Set Django Settings Values
Adjust the values for the following settings in the newly created .env file:

- `ALLOWED_HOSTS` : Specify the domain of the server to make the app accessible. Refer to [this section](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#allowed-hosts) in the Django documentation for further details.
- `SECRET_KEY` : Assign a unique and unpredictable value. Utilize a [Django secret key generator](https://djecrety.ir/) for assistance. The `SECRET_KEY` is crucial for various security purposes in Django, as explained in the [documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#secret-key).
- `DEBUG` : Ensure this variable is set to False. Debug mode should never be enabled in a production environment. For further details, refer to [this section](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#std-setting-DEBUG) of the Django docs.


### Step 4: Setup a reCAPTCHA Site
To run this project in a production environment, it is necessary to generate your own reCAPTCHA site keys. This can be achieved by creating a new site through the [Google reCAPTCHA console](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/). Choose the reCAPTCHA type as Challenge (v2) and opt for the Invisible reCAPTCHA Badge. Subsequently, include the domain where the implementation will be utilized. A screenshot illustrating the required configuration is attached for your reference.

Upon completion of the setup process, you will gain access to the reCAPTCHA keys. Subsequently, please proceed to update the `.env` file, assigning the site key to `RECAPTCHA_PUBLIC` and the secret key to `RECAPTCHA_PRIVATE`.
